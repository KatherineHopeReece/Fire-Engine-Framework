Attached are data created using a combination of:
1. Kasra's Model Agnostic Framework(https://github.com/CH-Earth/agnostic-orchestrator), 
2. Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (https://github.com/cffdrs/cffdrs_r), 
3. Brett Moore's BurnP3HelpR script (https://github.com/BadgerOnABike/BurnP3.HelpR)

This data has been sourced from Government of Alberta and Government of Canada sources: 

1. FBP Fuel Type Fuel Layer: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/4e66dd2f-5cd0-42fd-b82c-a430044b31de
2. Meteorology Station Data: https://acis.alberta.ca/acis/weather-data-viewer.jsp
3. National Park Data: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/9e1507cd-f25c-4c64-995b-6563bf9d65bd


The data has been tested using the standardized Prometheus Model, so *should* be working.
