This repository includes scripts from 2 theoretical workflows. 

Scripts numbers 0-3 include calculations for FWI and FBP variables. The remaining python scripts include just mathematical equations to better represent the growth of the fire front across the landscape. 

Workflow 1: 
  Requires the DEM, Fuel Layer Type, a Meteorology Station, Ignition Point or Ignition Grid. 
  This workflow aims to bypass the CFFDRS script by trying to calculate the FWI and FBP values then predict spread based on the chosen ignition location/locations. 

Workflow 2:
  Requires that you first clone the CFFDRS script and independently run the FWI.r and FBP.r functions and obtain the resulting CSVs. 
  The CSVs have the inputs used for the equations in ROS_Math.py and ROS_Spread.py.

The ROS_Math.py has the better mathematical representation of spread along the fire front, as well as the geometry of the fire perimeter. 

To do:
  1. Proofreading of Equations.
  2. Proofreading of structure and order.
  3. Proper organization of scripts.
  4. Proper importation of functions.
  5. Creation of needed classes. 


This repository includes the test data that can be used to test the improvements, additions and changes to these scripts. 

A fun work in progress :)
